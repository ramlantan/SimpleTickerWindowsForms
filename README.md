# SimpleTicker
**This project is old, busted, and abandoned. A new ticker based on WPF is currently being developed.** *soon™*
A simple™ crypto asset ticker

# Instructions
By default, the ticker will ignore clicks and no interaction is allowed.
Hold a Control (CTRL) key while clicking to drag the ticker around. Hold Control while right clicking to access settings or close the ticker.

# Compiling 
I distribute the EXE with the Newtonsoft.Json.dll embedded in the exe for easier portability.
If compiling from source, you will need to either keep the Newtonsoft.Json.dll with the exe, or use ILMerge to embed the dll in the exe.
