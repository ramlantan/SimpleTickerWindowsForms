# SimpleTicker
### A simple (looking) cryptocurrency asset ticker for Windows.

**This project is terrible and probably won't be updated, but should probably work. A new ticker based on WPF is being made.**\
*please look forward to it*

**Download:** https://github.com/ramlantan/SimpleTickerWindowsForms/releases

Cross-platform versions might be made in the future.

## Instructions
By default, the ticker will ignore clicks and no interaction is allowed.
Hold a Control (CTRL) key while clicking to drag the ticker around. Hold Control while right clicking to access settings or close the ticker.

## Anti-virus
Anti-virus may flag this due to using a global keyboard hook, which is used for click-through functionality.

## Problems
If a ticker displays "$-1", try confirming the URL of the coin on CoinMarketCap's website.\

## Compiling source
You can compile the source yourself by downloading the free Community version of Visual Studio 2017 here:\
