# SimpleTicker
**This project is old, busted, and abandoned. A new ticker based on WPF is currently being developed.** 
*please look forward to it*

A simple (looking) crypto asset ticker for Windows.

Download the latest release here:
https://github.com/ramlantan/SimpleTickerWindowsForms/releases
Cross-platform versions may be made in the future.

## Instructions
By default, the ticker will ignore clicks and no interaction is allowed.
Hold a Control (CTRL) key while clicking to drag the ticker around. Hold Control while right clicking to access settings or close the ticker.

## Problems
If a ticker displays "$-1", try confirming the URL of the coin on CoinMarketCap's website. 
https://coinmarketcap.com/

## Anti-virus
Anti-virus may flag this due to using a global keyboard hook, which is used for click-through functionality.
