# SimpleTicker
**This project is old, busted, and abandoned. A new ticker based on WPF is currently being developed.** *soon™*

A simple™ crypto asset ticker

# Instructions
By default, the ticker will ignore clicks and no interaction is allowed.
Hold a Control (CTRL) key while clicking to drag the ticker around. Hold Control while right clicking to access settings or close the ticker.

# Anti-virus
Anti-virus may flag this as a virus due to using a global keyboard hook, which is used for click-through functionality.
